Smart Cabin Price Predictor
Final project for the Building AI course

Summary
This project develops a machine learning model to estimate the market price of Finnish summer cottages (mökkis) based on their key features. It's a Building AI course project designed to help buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the real estate market.

Background
The Finnish cabin market can be opaque, with prices varying significantly based on factors like size, location, and amenities. Buyers often struggle to assess fair value, and sellers may inadvertently under- or overprice their properties. This issue is common across various real estate markets globally. My personal motivation stems from the practical application of AI to real-world valuation challenges, aiming to make complex financial decisions more data-driven and transparent.

Problem 1: Inconsistent pricing and valuation in the cabin market.

Problem 2: Lack of accessible, data-driven valuation tools for ordinary buyers and sellers.

Problem 3: The manual appraisal process can be time-consuming and subjective.

How is it used?
The solution is envisioned as a simple web-based tool. Users (potential cabin buyers, sellers, or real estate agents) would input key details of a specific cabin, such as its size, the size of its sauna, distance to water, number of indoor toilets, and proximity to neighbors. The trained machine learning model would then instantly provide an estimated market price.

Situations: The solution is useful when individuals are considering buying or selling a summer cottage, or when real estate professionals need quick, data-backed estimates. It can be accessed anytime, anywhere with an internet connection.

Users: Individual cabin owners, prospective buyers, real estate agencies, and potentially financial institutions involved in property valuation. Key user needs include ease of use, quick response times, and a reasonable level of prediction accuracy.

Here's an illustrative screenshot of what the input and predicted output might look like:


This is how you create code examples:

# Example of a simplified prediction function
def predict_price(size, sauna_size, water_dist, toilets, neighbor_dist):
    # These coefficients are illustrative and would be learned from real data
    c_size, c_sauna, c_water, c_toilets, c_neighbor = 3000, 200, -50, 5000, 100
    
    predicted_price = (c_size * size) + \
                      (c_sauna * sauna_size) + \
                      (c_water * water_dist) + \
                      (c_toilets * toilets) + \
                      (c_neighbor * neighbor_dist)
    return predicted_price

# Example usage:
# estimated_price = predict_price(size=85, sauna_size=10, water_dist=15, toilets=1, neighbor_dist=100)
# print(f"Predicted Cabin Price: {estimated_price} €")

Data sources and AI methods
The data for training this predictive model would ideally come from comprehensive real estate listings databases (e.g., public property records, real estate portals like Etuovi.com or Oikotie.fi in Finland). Data collection would typically involve web scraping and API access, followed by extensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to prepare it for machine learning.

The primary AI method employed in this project is Linear Regression, chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in predicting continuous values like property prices. As an alternative or for comparison, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression could also be explored due to its intuitive nature and strong performance in similar prediction tasks.

Challenges
This project, in its current scope, does not aim to solve every aspect of cabin valuation. Specific limitations and ethical considerations include:

Limited Features: The model currently uses a simplified set of features. It does not account for critical factors like the year of construction, renovation status, specific lake quality (e.g., clarity, fish stock), specific geographical micro-location, access roads, or unique amenities (e.g., boat dock, private beach).

Data Availability & Quality: Obtaining comprehensive, clean, and representative real estate data can be challenging. Missing values or biases in the available data could impact model accuracy and fairness.

Ethical Considerations:

Bias: If the training data disproportionately represents certain types of cabins or regions, the model's predictions might be biased against others, potentially reinforcing existing inequalities in the market.

Over-reliance: Users might over-rely on the predicted price without considering qualitative factors or unique aspects of a property, leading to suboptimal decisions.

Privacy: While the model uses property features, ensuring that no personally identifiable information is inadvertently processed or revealed is crucial.

What next?
To evolve this project into a more robust and comprehensive solution, several next steps could be pursued:

Feature Expansion: Integrate a wider array of relevant features, such as property age, last renovation date, material quality indicators, satellite imagery analysis for land quality, and more granular geographical data (e.g., postal codes, specific lake names).

Advanced Models: Experiment with more sophisticated machine learning models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), or even deep learning approaches for improved predictive power.

Web Application Development: Build a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction, allowing users to input cabin details and visualize predictions on a map.

Continuous Learning: Implement a system for the model to continuously learn from new listing data and user feedback to maintain accuracy over time.

Collaboration: Seek collaboration with real estate experts and appraisers to validate model outputs and gain deeper domain insights.

Skills needed to move forward include advanced machine learning engineering, full-stack web development, cloud infrastructure management, and data pipeline expertise. Assistance in securing access to richer, high-quality real estate datasets would significantly accelerate development.
